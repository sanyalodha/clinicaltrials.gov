    "Welcome to the Midterm Project! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is comprehensive, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, since problems can vary quite a bit in difficulty, some problems will be worth more points than others. Finally, in a project, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you **start early** on the project! It will take the place of a homework in the week that it is due, but you should also expect it to take longer than a homework. You are especially encouraged to **find a partner** to work through the project with. If you work in a pair, you must follow the [Pair Programming Guidelines](https://dsc10.com/pair-programming/) on the course website. In particular, you must work together at the same time, and you are not allowed to split up the problems and each work on certain problems. If working in a pair, you should submit one notebook to Gradescope for the both of you. Use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zs1CuHFlhYITrMfD6mSTTH9V27o9Z1WcbYpo0RLvWik/edit?usp=sharing) to find someone else to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). Directly sharing answers between groups is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid looping through DataFrames. Do not import any packages.** Loops in Python are slow, and looping through DataFrames should usually be avoided in favor of the DataFrame commands we've learned in class, which are much faster. Please do not import any additional packages - you don't need them, and our autograder may not be able to run your code if you do.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "During the end of the year 2019, the novel coronavirus started spreading around the world, causing many people to contract COVID-19. It didn't take long for the virus to spread from Wuhan, China to pretty much everywhere else in the world. At first, no one realized the severity of the virus and its potential to change lives as drastically as it has. In February 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States started to grow exponentially. Various measures, like face covering regulations, stay at home mandates, and vaccines, have helped control the virus, but it still continues to affect the world greatly, even two years later. In the US, there have been over 80 million cases of COVID-19, and nearly 1 million people have died as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be analyzing COVID-19 data in the United States, using national data from fall 2020, broken down by state and by day. The data we have comes from the [COVID-19 Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), License: CC BY 4.0.\n",

    "### Outline of the Project \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into eight sections, most of which contain several questions. Use the outline below to help you quickly navigate to the part of the project you're working on. Questions are worth one point each, except the questions shown in bold in the outline are worth two points (and you can expect them to be harder, more complex questions).\n",

    "To better prepare for our subsequent analysis, let's extract the year, month, and day from this string. We *could* do this with the string methods we've seen before, but Python actually provides an easier way to work with dates. The `datetime` module, which we'll import, has a function that can read in a string in month/day/year format and convert it into what's called a `datetime` object. This function, `.strptime`,  takes in two arguments: a string that we want to convert, and a [*format string*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) that tells Python what each part of the input string represents. For our application, since the string is input in the format month/day/year, we will use the format string \"%m/%d/%y\". \n",

    "You'll notice that many of the states that appear in this bar chart are large, highly populated states, like California and Texas. In order to get a more accurate view of the impact of COVID at the statewide level, we'll need to consider the population of each state alongside the raw number of positive test results. Hang on to that thought: we'll be looking at state population data later in this project in Section 6. "

    "### Section 4: Exponential Growth? 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that has caused great concern throughout the pandemic has been the potential for exponential spread of the virus. That's why we often hear health organizations like the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization advocating for people to stay at home early, before the growth of the virus swells out of control. Let's see if the virus was spreading exponentially in the US during fall 2020. The easiest way to do that is to look at a data visualization!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.1.** Plot a line graph showing the growth of the cumulative **total** number of positive cases in the US throughout the fall. In your plot, the x-axis should represent the days from October 1 to December 31 and the y-axis should represent the total number of positive cases in the US recorded on or before each day. (Don't worry too much about the labels on your x-axis; they may not display in a typical format for a date, and that's fine.) Give your plot a title of \"US total cases\" by using the keyword argument `title=\"US total cases\"` within the `plot` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: You should see a smooth curve that increases from left to right. If your curve looks jagged, or shows any decreases, look carefully at the data being used for your x-axis, and make sure it's in chronological order. "

    "From the plot above, we can see that the number of new cases seems to drop in late December; however, due to the large fluctuations throughout, it is hard to tell if there are any other periods in which the COVID situation was improving, with fewer new cases than before. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we introduce a *[rolling average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average)* to calculate the average number of new cases per day over a [seven-day period](https://gillingscovid19.unc.edu/definitions/7-day-average-of-new-cases), thereby smoothing out daily fluctuations and allowing us to see overall patterns more clearly. In the case of COVID-19, the rolling average is a critical tool to show [significant peaks and valleys over a period of time](https://www.georgiaruralhealth.org/blog/what-is-a-moving-average-and-why-is-it-useful/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.3.** Construct a new DataFrame  called `covid_roll` indexed by the `'month'` and `'day'`, with just one column `'positiveIncreaseRoll'` containing the 7-day rolling average of new positive cases for the entire US, using the data in the `'positiveIncrease'` column of the `covid` DataFrame. Round each rolling average to two decimal places. Since it's not possible to calculate a seven-day rolling average for the first six days of data, `'positiveIncreaseRoll'` should have NaN or 0 for the first 6 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, we've provided the function `rolling_average` below. Please feel free to use it, but make sure you read through the code to understand what it does. You can also write your own code, if you prefer. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: If you are interested, you may also want to look at the function [`DataFrame.rolling()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html) as it is a helpful function for calculating rolling averages in `pandas`, but it's not implemented as part of `babypandas`."

    "We can see the increase in covid cases to be on an increasing trend from October to December. Possible reason could be that if you see that the highest peak is during Christmas time so people are busy shopping and visiting their families which leads to more spread. Now another thing we notice is that near the end of November, there is a drop. This could be explained by the fact that this drop is during the time of Thanksgiving where most people stay at home and have dinner.

    "**Question 4.6.** Create a function called `state_trend` that creates a line plot similar to the one you created in Question 4.4, except for an individual state. The function should take as input the two-letter postal code abbreviation for a state and generate the line plot showing that state's seven-day rolling average of new cases, throughout the fall. The function does not need to return anything. Make the title of the plot be \"XX new cases, 7-day average\", where \"XX\" is replaced by the two-letter postal code given as input.\n",

    "Test out your function on a few different states, and use the plots you generate to answer the multiple-choice question below. "

    "Without knowing the population of each state, purely comparing the number of positive tests gives a very biased impression of which states are faring better in their battle against the coronavirus. As we saw in Question 3.6, for example, populous states like California and Texas are likely to have more positive tests than states like Wyoming and Vermont, simply because they have far more people. In order to fairly compare states with different populations, we need to look at proportions, or rates. \n",

    "\n",
    "It has long been advocated by public health experts, including the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control, that wearing a mask can prevent the spread of COVID-19. We would like to see how this plays out in our data, using a dataset of which states have had state-wide mask mandates and which dates they were in effect. This data comes from an article by [U.S. News and World Report](https://www-usnews-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/these-are-the-states-with-mask-mandates?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&context=amp&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16110233502761&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fnews%2Fbest-states%2Farticles%2Fthese-are-the-states-with-mask-mandates) and some webscraping for missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as of April 12, 2022, all states in the United States have gotten rid of mask mandates though many states still recommend wearing a mask in indoor settings where social distancing is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the mandate end date in the dataset is the date when indoor masking for **vaccinated individuals** was no longer required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, as the article points out, the details of the mask mandate differed from state to state. There were states that did not issue a state-wide mandate but allowed for individual counties and cities to do so. Some states banned individual counties and cities from implementing a mandate at all. In states that had mandates, they applied in different situations: public transportation, schools, etc. The dataset does not capture such detailed information on the mandates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is located at `data/mask_mandate.csv`. Let's read it in."

    "You should see a pretty clear negative association here, showing that the states with longer-lasting mask mandates had fewer new positive cases from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Of course, some of the mask mandates lasted a lot longer than the time period covered here, which was only 92 days. Therefore, it's not the fact that certain states had mandates lasting hundreds of days that *caused* fewer new positive cases from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, as most of those long-lasting mandates hadn't even happened yet! Rather, a likely confounding factor is that the states that imposed and tolerated long-lasting mandates are the same states where residents were being cautious about gathering in groups, were wearing masks in fall 2020, and were generally following public health directives.
